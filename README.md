Our objective in this project is to develop a middle -fidelity prototype of a message exchanging platform over the span of 4 sprints, where each sprint has a duration of 2 weeks. The development of the product is done in groups of 6 following the Agile development apporach. Github is used as the platform of choice for version control, access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, and continuous integration.

# Project detail

Communication is a must when it comes to working on large projects, maintaining relationships, and connecting communities. One of the tools that can facilitate team collaboration is a communication platform. The goal of our project “ChatHaven” is a communication platform which provides an intuitive and organized environment to stay connected. Users in the platform are either an admin or a member. Admins can create or delete messages and moderate channels. Members can send private messages among themselves and send messages which are visible to all users in a channel.
