Communication is a must when it comes to working on large projects, maintaining relationships, and connecting communities. One of the tools that can facilitate team collaboration is a communication platform. The goal of our project “ChatHaven” is a communication platform which provides an intuitive and organized environment to stay connected. Individuals in the platform are in either of the following roles: admin or member. Admins can create or delete messages and moderate channels.
