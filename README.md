<p align="justify">
Communication is a must when it comes to working on large projects, maintaining relationships, and connecting communities. One of the tools that can facilitate team collaboration is a communication platform. The goal of our project “ChatHaven” is a communication platform which provides an intuitive and organized environment to stay connected. Users in the platform are either an admin or a member. Admins can create or delete messages and moderate channels. Members can send private messages among themselves and send messages which are visible to all users in a channel.
